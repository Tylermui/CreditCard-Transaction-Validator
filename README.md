# CreditCard-Transaction-Validator

This project was assigned in my CS202 class where we write in Java. 
It takes in two text files and splits them by commas into their own objects. 
The program then begins to sort the data and check if a transaction is valid or not.
There are multiple credit card objects created to check the different outcomes of each transaction.
There are examples of Object Oriented Programming, Inheritence, and Polymorphism
